 <h1> The Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
 <h2> No Backpacks! </h2>
 <blockquote cite= "whereever your source comes from">
   This is a really long quote that will definitely be over four lines by the time I am done typing it.
   Right now it is only short paragraph, but over time as I continue typeing, it becomes a longer paragraph.
   This is also a sentence. Additionally, this is a sentence.
   Moreover, I am done typing this now.

 <p>At my middle school, students were not allowed to bring backpacks into class.
  This rule was set because a few teachers thought the students were using our backpacks as a reason not to use our lockers.
   <br> At the time I thoguht this rule was ridiculous because every student's textbooks, binders, and notebooks had to stay in the classroom.</br>
   The rule was completely unnecessary because no one ever had a reason to use the lockers anyway. </p>

   <p> It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> <s>apple</s>...I mean avocado she had ever had. </p>
